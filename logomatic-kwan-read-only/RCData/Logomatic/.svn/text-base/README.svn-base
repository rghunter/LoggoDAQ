For full details, read the original Sparkfun Logomatic docs, the Sparkfun

- Installation -
Copy FW.SFE to the Logomatic memory card and restart the Logomatic. Make sure to
delete the LOGCON.TXT file from any old Sparkfun version of the firmware, as 
this is incompatible with that. LOGCON.TXT from version 1.0 is still compatible.
The firmware will create its own LOGCON.TXT as a template if needed, just as the 
old version did. 

Changes since version 1.0

- Many bug fixes and code clean up
- GPS time sync now works in NMEA
- Powersave feature added
